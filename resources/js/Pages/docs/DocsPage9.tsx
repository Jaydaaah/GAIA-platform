                This research involves developing an AI-driven assessment
                platform to reduce exam anxiety and enhance student performance.
                The methodology includes selecting an AI model from providers
                like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google, followed by system design,
                implementation, and user testing. These phases ensure the

                evaluation.
