                personalized, interactive learning through conversational and
                generative AI. Students engage in low-stakes, AI-driven
                assessments with adaptive feedback, promoting understanding and
                highlighting strengths and areas for improvement. Simulated
                exams replicate test conditions but focus on learning rather
                than high-stakes grading. GAIA also offers personalized writing
                and analytical support. Educators benefit from a dashboard that
                tracks student progress and performance trends, facilitating
                balanced automated and human feedback. By promoting positive
                reinforcement and reducing stress, GAIA helps students build
                confidence and enhance academic performance.`);
